h3. Demo project for exposing Play! Framework bug.

Data stored in the flash scope can become persistent.

The recipe is very simple:
* first, put something to flash with arbitrary key (i.e. "warning") in interceptor (or index page);
* second, put success or error message to flash in other action (i.e. "add") and redirect to index page;
* reload index page for multiple times and see that success and error messages in the flash scope are stored.

Affected framework versions: 1.2.5.1, 1.2.6, 1.2.x-1.2.6-14-g9b5db0e.
Not affected: 1.2.5.

Tested on these JREs:
* 1.7.0.25.

Tested on these OSes:
* Centos 5.9 i386 (OpenVZ-virtualized);
* Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 (baremetal).

Was not tested on Windows.

Bug is reproduced in DEV or PROD modes both, so you can launch this app with "play test" or "play run --%prod".
