h3. Demo project for exposing "play-tests":https://github.com/codeborne/play-tests module bug.

Running "play ui-tests" results in "org.hibernate.PropertyAccessException: could not get a field value by reflection getter of models.Message.text" error.

Affected framework versions: 1.3.x-3ba2934 (latest commit on 2014-04-21).

Tested on these JREs:
* 1.7.0.55/1.8.0.5.

Tested on these OSes:
* Ubuntu 12.04 x86_64 (baremetal).

h3. Problem solved - just disable precompiled mode is play-tests' build.gradle for uitest task.
